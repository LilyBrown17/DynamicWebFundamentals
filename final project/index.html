                Alola, everyone, and welcome to the official BOOM! Fanfic-a-latta! website! Here on this site, you'll be able to find links and lyrics for all of my currently public song covers, of all varieties! (Except for the covers made using UTAU. Those aren't here. Sorry, people who are fans of my Rei Nintone & Yuri SAIS stuff specifically.)

                This site will try to stay up to date as I release new covers, in an attempt to keep all of you updated. Hopefully, you all enjoy this gallery of my content, and find some use in the lyrics library! If you have any questions, try to shoot me a comment over on my channel proper if you get the chance. I'll keep an eye out for anyone trying to flag me down for help.
