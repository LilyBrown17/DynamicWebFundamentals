            <br>And I won't let you stop
            <br>My Lord (and ward) the Koopa King!

            <br>
            <br>Bowser/Kamek: And in the final hour of fading light!
            <br>Standing together in might,<br>Pushing back the night!
            <br>
            <br>And in the final hour our stars will shine!
            <br>Starlight and powers aligned
            <br>In the final fight!`

			`<br>Looking at the sky as
            <br>All the leaves fall
            <br>Swirling round in the breeze as I can't help but think of the time
            <br>When we first saw this sight
            <br>
            <br>I will always feel it
            <br>The nostalgia
            <br>As the gold, red, and orange of the autumn-kissed trees all bring to mind
            <br>
            <br>Walking back on this winding path through 
            <br>Fields of yellow that never brown
            <br>Maple, chesnut, and cherry trees
            <br>All bathed in an autumn light
            <br>
            <br>Paper leaves falling in the breeze as
            <br>I stand up on the overlook
            <br>Forever this place will be remembered
            <br>As where I met you
            <br>
            <br>If I listen closely
            <br>There's a voice that's
            <br>Calling out on the breeze that can't help but remind me of you
            <br>And the times that we shared
            <br>
            <br>Autumn colors twirling
            <br>Up above while
            <br>I look back on the bond we quickly formed while traveling through this place
            <br>
            <br>If these leaves were a thousand cranes I
            <br>Know exactly for what I'd wish
            <br>Let me see you just one more time 
            <br>Before all the color fades
            <br>
            <br>Past the riverbed, up the mountain
            <br>Everything seems so peaceful still
            <br>Everywhere that I look all I see are
            <br>Memories of you!
            <br>
            <br>Oh
            <br>Wishing that we'd only had more time
            <br>Looking down from the guillotine
            <br>Can't help but wonder why
            <br>You had to go
            <br>
            <br>Standing here and watching
            <br>With a hope that,
            <br>Despite being impossible, I still hold dear deep inside
            <br>That you'll maybe return
            <br>
            <br>Trying not to cry as
            <br>I remember
            <br>Everything that you meant to me and as I wish for what could have been
            <br>
            <br>Holding tightly the memories that
            <br>We made together in this place
            <br>Maple, chesnut, and cherry trees
            <br>All bathed in an autumn light
            <br>
            <br>Bring me peace as I cry aloud and
            <br>Wish that you hadn't had to go
            <br>Forever this place will be remembered
            <br>As where I met you
            <br>
            <br>Tell me, am I crazy?
            <br>Is it wrong that
            <br>I just wish that we had a second chance or could turn back time
            <br>To when you were still here
            <br>
            <br>Please give me a reason
            <br>Just a sign that
            <br>There's a way to move on from all this heartbreak your sacrifice has caused
            <br>
            <br>If my lament cannot be heard then
            <br>Just grant me this my one request
            <br>Let me see you just one more time 
            <br>Before all the color fades
            <br>
            <br>Tears will always begin to fall when
            <br>I stand up on the mountain here
            <br>Everywhere that I look all I see are
            <br>Memories of you!
            <br>
            <br>Oh
            <br>Wishing that our time wasn't so short
            <br>Trapped inside of this steel caged formed
            <br>Of all the pain I feel
            <br>From losing you`

			`<br>It all happened on August 15th at about 12:30pm in the afternoon 
            <br>The weather really nice
            <br>Sunlight shining down with a light bright enough to make me feel ill, the heat stroke coming on
            <br>With nothing else to do, I was sitting on the swing talking to you
            <br>
            <br>“But I think I kinda hate the summertime”
            <br>You muttered brazenly to me while stroking the black cat cradled in your arms tenderly 
            <br>Then it kept away and so did you
            <br>Trying to catch it as it ran right into the street and you followed,
            <br>I tried to call you back 
            <br>All I can see is RED
            <br>
            <br>Hitting you and drowning out my scream
            <br>The truck tried to stop but couldn't fast enough 
            <br>Tears staining up my face, your blood staining up the place
            <br>The scent and the colors mixed, I won't accept it
            <br>The haze sneers, like something in a dream 
            <br>As it says, “It's no joke, can't handle it? Then tough!”
            <br>Rippling the summer lake, it's far more than I can take
            <br>All fades to black with the noises of the crickets!
            <br>
            <br>Coming back to my senses, I wake in my bed as the hands of a clock keep ticking by
            <br>What time is it again?
            <br>Just past midnight on August 14th, now 15th, the crickets song still chirping in my ears
            <br>I can't tell if it happened or not, this nightmare feels just way too real
            <br>
            <br>Sitting here, it's so mysterious to me
            <br>Because the dream from yesterday happened in this same park where I'm sitting here with you now
            <br>“I should probably go home for the day”
            <br>But then while we were on our way, the people around looked in horror 
            <br>They gasp and point and scream 
            <br>All I can see is RED
            <br>
            <br>Falling, piercing right into your heart,
            <br>A sharp metal pole came crashing from above
            <br>Loud, tearing shrieks go by, wind-chime echoes full the sky 
            <br>All sounding and ringing through the streets and trees again 
            <br>Here's the haze, it's tearing me apart,
            <br>Saying “It's not a dream, say goodbye to your love”
            <br>Once more, my eyes go dark, it's fading away the park
            <br>But I could glimpse a grin on your face before then
            <br>
            <br>One dark world after another all good by
            <br>As the haze steals me away each time I see you die
            <br>For 10 years I've been stuck watching you
            <br>As it keeps repeating, tell me, have you noticed too?
            <br>Every story like this seems to end the same
            <br>In a loop, unending, like some kind of twisted game
            <br>But I know that there's an end beyond this summer day
            <br>
            <br>Hitting me and drowning out your scream
            <br>The truck tried to stop but couldn't fast enough 
            <br>Tears staining up your face, my blood staining up the place
            <br>The scent and the colors mixed, I will accept it
            <br>The haze scowls, like I've messed up it's dream 
            <br>As I says, “It's no joke, can't handle it? Then tough!”
            <br>This normal summer day, will finally go away
            <br>All fades to black with the noises of the crickets!
            <br>
            <br>Just past midnight on August 14th, now 15th, the crickets song still chirping in her ears
            <br>A girl sits up in bed
            <br>Tightly hugging her cat all alone as she cries and simply says “It didn't work again”`

			`<br>Shotgun and a fender telecaster - 
            <br>All in a row, my refrain unhappy
            <br>Out alone here, on the city streets - 
            <br>Do you hear all the gunfire? Is it scary?
            <br>I sang all my voice out while it lasted - 
            <br>How much time have I now gone and wasted?
            <br>Finally I've got you in my arms, 
            <br>And you can know I'm not about to let you go
            <br>
            <br>"One man live, phenomanal success!" 
            <br>My head overflowing with shoujo manga
            <br>Out of ammo, no more shots remain - 
            <br>So I guess that it's time to turn back for now and wait
            <br>How many times have I taken full advantage 
            <br>Of all the ready for me perfect circumstances?
            <br>To this stupid life I'm saying "bye-bye" - 
            <br>Now my ride's almost here, I'll be going soon enough
            <br>
            <br>Ask "What's wrong with this picture?", it's making me dizzy
            <br>My past's stuck out of sight, could somebody explain it to me?
            <br>I've got everything, got everything that I need
            <br>Alright? Alright? Alright?
            <br>
            <br>I guess you could say that I'm pretty lucky
            <br>With these 39 seconds, on a loop repeating. 
            <br>I saw it, does that mean I'm finally happy?
            <br>Like the heck it does! Why'd you assume it did?
            <br>No matter how much sound I lay down again, 
            <br>there's no end, and no beginning to the cycle I'm in
            <br>To sum it all up, you could say it's pointless!
            <br>You don't seem to get all that I'm going through
            <br>
            <br>Out beyond the screen, too far to be seen
            <br>An upside-down girl in an adult's world.
            <br>
            <br>Shotgun and a fender telecaster - 
            <br>Not a word left, my chances unlucky
            <br>Wounded, broken, game over;
            <br>Doesn't it hurt to look out at all the pain again?
            <br>Harshly stumbling over every rhyme, 
            <br>I gave up on "one more time"
            <br>Every roll was just another fault - 
            <br>And each one had you rolling and laughing in my face
            <br>
            <br>One-man live, phenomanal success - 
            <br>The festival makes me so sentimental
            <br>Well, the breakup is unanimous - 
            <br>So can we turn around, and get far away from here?
            <br>I sang all my voice out while it lasted - 
            <br>How much time have I now gone and wasted?
            <br>Finally you came into my hands - 
            <br>Say, how are you faring? Are you doing all right?
            <br>
            <br>Unpleasant dreams recur, making me feel uneasy...
            <br>That's the fate you get if you've forgotten how to make mistakes...
            <br>Please, make me what I want to be - no, no more
            <br>Alright? Alright? Alright?
            <br>
            <br>So why is it that you would call this happy?
            <br>Up until four in the morning, eyes so dull and empty, 
            <br>and wherever I end up - is that happy?
            <br>But it's so fatiguing, I don't feel the thrill…
            <br>How is this, oh, how can you call this this happy?
            <br>I'm sprawled out here on the freeway, with no ending in sight, 
            <br>and it's all just starting to crumble away
            <br>It seem's you're a roadblock now, at any rate...
            <br>
            <br>I guess you could say that I'm pretty happy
            <br>With these 39 seconds on a loop repeating. 
            <br>I saw it, does that mean I'm finally lucky?
            <br>Strange, because I'm not seeing any reward…
            <br>The sounds only pile up, echoing loud, 
            <br>and no end and no beginning to the cycle I'm in
            <br>To sum it all up, you could say it's pointless!
            <br>Right, then, I'll just be jumping off right away!
            <br>
            <br>Out beyond the screen, too far to be seen
            <br>An upside-down girl in an adult's world.
            <br>
            <br>So am I happy?`

            <br>A kingdom of isolation
            <br>And it looks like I'm the queen
            <br>
            <br>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
            <br>Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

            <br>Don't let them in, don't let them see

            <br>
            <br>It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
            <br>And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

            <br>And I'll rise like the break of dawn
            <br>Let it go, let it go
            <br>That perfect girl is gone
            <br>Here I stand in the light of day

            <br>Oceans blue and fields of emerald green
            <br>And everything else that comes between 
            <br>Over mountains and deserts, over fire and snow
            <br>Holding tightly, come on, here we go!
            <br>
            <br>Buildings old and lost to earth and time
            <br>Towers standing tall and ready to climb
            <br>There's a new spring breeze blowing, a new era's begun

            <br>The world without me spins like every day
            <br>This is it, the answer that I need
            <br>It has to be

            <br>Well I just began having my fun, baby
            <br>Some people live for attention, playing the victim
            <br>But baby, I was born to do the killin'
            <br>
            <br>I see how you're going crazy
            <br>Always thinkin' 'bout me, baby on the daily
            <br>Feed me your negativity
            <br>Talk some more about me
            <br>I know that you love me, love me
            <br>
            <br>Funny how you think I'm bothered
            <br>Know I'm nothing like the others
            <br>You shouldn't have messed with me, 'cause I heard
            <br>That you're afraid of monsters, monsters

            <br>I'm just being me

            <br>And I don't care if you disagree
            <br>I don't need no sympathy
            <br>Winning the game on my own
            <br>Yeah baby
            <br>

            <br>Ah, it could've been so different between us
            <br>But then you went and messed everything up
            <br>You took a knife and stabbed me in the back
            <br>Took everything I had
            <br>Went to your friends and laughed

			`<br>Rolling Girl, it's always just the same,
            <br>Dreaming dreams that don't come true
            <br>Through the clamor and noise inside her head
            <br>Churning over again, churning over again
            <br>
            <br>A lonely girl just muttering "I'm fine",
            <br>Have words failed her again to this lie?
            <br>A failure, a failure.
            <br>Obsessing over her every mistake, it makes everything spin again!
            <br>
            <br>One more time, one more time
            <br>“Once again, today, this girl will keep on rolling”
            <br>So she said, so she said
            <br>Breathing life into the words where there wasn't any!
            <br>“How 'bout now?” “No, not yet,
            <br>We still can't see what lies ahead in the future here.
            <br>Just try to hold your breath, for now.”
            <br>
            <br>Rolling Girl, it's how it ends for her
            <br>Can't reach the colors she longs to see
            <br>The overlapping voices in her ears,
            <br>Blend together again, blend together again
            <br>
            <br>She mutters, "I'm fine", another time,
            <br>but the false words continue to fail her
            <br>I don't even care about how it ends
            <br>Anymore as it's always an upward climb that I'll just fail again
            <br>
            <br>One more time, one more time
            <br>"Please, could someone help to get me rolling onward"
            <br>The girl said, the girl said
            <br>With her words conveyed even in the heavy silence!
            <br>“How 'bout now?” “Just a bit more,
            <br>Soon we should see something ahead in the future here.
            <br>Just try to hold your breath, for now.”
            <br>
            <br>One more time, one more time
            <br>“Once again, today, this girl will keep on rolling”
            <br>So she said, so she said
            <br>Breathing joy into the words where there wasn't any!
            <br>“How 'bout now? You can look now.
            <br>You must be exhausted from all of the rolling, here
            <br>We'll both just hold our breath, for now.”`

			`<br>Hey buddy!
            <br>You okay? You look kind of tired
            <br>Do you need a moment?
            <br>Don't worry, it's fine
            <br>I don't blame you for taking a rest after all that
            <br>Heck, I could go for a nice relaxing defragmentation myself
            <br>But, before you settle down
            <br>You up for a little survey to help us improve the park?
            <br>
            <br>Thanks for visiting Indigo Park
            <br>Hope all your dreams came true
            <br>If you've got some time and you're up for a lark
            <br>Stick around for the Rambley Review!
            <br>I'm here to offer my best
            <br>To each valuable guest I assist
            <br>And lots of happy feedback
            <br>Ensures I get to exist

            <br>Were you satisfied with the rides? (Yes or no?)
            <br>Were you satisfied with your guide? (I sure hope so)
            <br>Do you plan to come back?
            <br>Will I see you again?
            <br>Did your experience convince you to tell a friend about us?
            <br>Did I earn your trust?
            <br>
            <br>At Indigo Park
            <br>There is a stark contrast
            <br>To everything I know this place should be
            <br>But out of the dark
            <br>You've given a spark of sunshine
            <br>To this kingdom's faithful devotee
            <br>
            <br>At Indigo Park
            <br>More than my remarks are mysteries
            <br>Even I don't know what we might find
            <br>But fight through the dark
            <br>And I'll be your spark of sunshine
            <br>To get you out of any bind
            <br>
            <br>That is, if you want to keep going
            <br>Oh, idea!
            <br>
            <br>I know all of this isn't fair to you
            <br>It's an awful lot to ask
            <br>But here comes Rambley Review Part Two
            <br>To sell you on our task
            <br>I'm here to view and assess each valuable guest as I learn
            <br>And lots of happy feedback ensures you're gonna return (right?)

            <br>I'm so happy you rode a ride (and saw the show)
            <br>I'm so happy to be your guide (more than you know)
            <br>So come back any time

            <br>In all my thousands of days
            <br>I've never had a friend like you
            <br>At least I hope I do

            <br>And I won't feel so left behind

			`<br>Gathering all life and meaning, every dream anyhow
            <br>Put into a body hoping it would allow
            <br>It'll be reanimating a life antiquated, moving now
            <br>
            <br>“Listen to a tale about his history if you dare”
            <br>Every single cell lamenting for a life unaware
            <br>“Want to see you again” they all hope, in the end
            <br>
            <br>Within a paper-mache façade
            <br>Call it a town—that's what I saw
            <br>Again, this experiment is going on just like I thought it would
            <br>And now, I wonder then would I have been a little better off erased?
            <br>Dreaming about a summer day as they went about their way,
            <br>From the following, they cannot run away:
            <br>
            <br>Where the traffic never goes, again there goes his body
            <br>Flying with a shattering of bone and so bloody
            <br>Watching as I can't awake, I see the girl bellowing out with tears abound
            <br>Coming to a halt—the second hand, a massive ending
            <br>Blinding all we see as every life around cannot pretend
            <br>I'm deep in a dream that will never end
            <br>
            <br>Gathering all meaning, every dream and shot that you get 
            <br>Doesn't matter, when the mind can never forget:
            <br>“In this world I know that hoping for harmony only brings regret”
            <br>
            <br>“Listen to a tale about their history if you dare”
            <br>With my artificially created heart that I bear,
            <br>The words that I say echo to nowhere
            <br>
            <br>With all the hot heat in the haze
            <br>Sound of the sun, their blazing gaze
            <br>The summer days again begin to cycle on with me bearing the heat of it
            <br>Hearing the sound of all the cicadas as I bear witness here
            <br>Once again, reaching out my hand, try to make them understand
            <br>But they'll never know as I'm fake in this land
            <br>
            <br>Where my sight could never go, again they made it all stop
            <br>Someone took a hold of time and forced another drop
            <br>Watching as the future once again would end, run over where I can't defend
            <br>Maybe I could leave this manufactured reality,
            <br>Leap into a time where red's only in the leaves that we see
            <br>If I had your eyes
            <br>
            <br>Could there be a future where the mocking rays of the sun finally go away, and this August now undone
            <br>Looking at each other they could smile again “See you next year” and laughing then?
            <br>Where there was a gap inside the world I thought was a trap
            <br>Rain began to fall even though nothing could forecast it all
            <br>And then at that time, only at that time-
            <br>
            <br>Even if the future with this August could be undone
            <br>Deep in those eyes-`
